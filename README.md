# [MS-Setting(s)](https://ms-setting.com)

This is a [website](https://ms-setting.com) that reproduces windows settings

## What for ?

If you are writing a tutorial that needs some tweaking of Windows Settings \
or if you want to help your old ones, this is perfect. You will find how easy \
it is to share - _without language barrier_ - where to tweak those settings

## How ?

[Microsoft doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/launch-settings-app)
was used to retrieve all the settings available.

## Try it yourself:

Paste `ms-settings:` in your browser \
It should prompt you if you want to enter or not Windows settings

As you can see it is no clickable link, so we made it possible to have them as links \
using this syntax: `https://ms-setting.com/?setting=YOUR_SETTING`

Like so:
[`https://ms-setting.com/?setting=ms-settings:`](https://ms-setting.com/?setting=ms-settings:)
